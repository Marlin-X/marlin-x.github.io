            <h2>About</h2>
            <p class="mb-3 medium">Marlin-X, first introduced in 2008, is a 60" long (tip of tail to tip of bill) lifelike marlin decoy is 100% handmade in the USA. The original Marlin-X design is the end product of years of design research aboard east coast marlin boats. Marlin-X is an aggressive swinging life size marlin teaser/decoy that mimics a real marlin attacking baits. The action is so realistic that you really need to use one to appreciate it.</p>
            <p class="mb-0 medium">In the beginning our own crew at Marlin-X were questioning if the application of a marlin decoy would hurt catch ratios but the data has shown almost zero reduction in catch ratio and in most cases a substantial increase in marlin sightings for the day.  We would recommend maybe not using Marlin-X on a 30+ fish day just from an efficiency standpoint but others days why not if it helps?</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p class="mb-3 medium">The idea of a marlin decoy was nothing new. Some form of a marlin decoy had been created and used for many years before. But the folks at Marlin-X felt that the marlin decoy concept had room for progression and work began to develop an all new product focused on effectiveness and quality.</p>
            <p class="mb-3 medium">In 2006 Aaron Horning (Marlin-X founder) hand carved the very first Marlin-X.</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote medium">
              <p class="mb-1 medium">"We established our trade space boundaries and worked within.</p>
              <ol class="medium">
                <li class="medium">It must float, not sink if disconnected from the boat</li>
                <li class="medium">It must be relatively large (60" length) but still easy to handle</li>
                <li class="medium">It must to have action like a real feeding marlin</li>
                <li class="medium">It must to be a quality product that a customer is excited about when received</li>
                <li class="medium">It must above all work to help a marlin boat attract more fish</li>
              </ol>
              <p class="mb-3 medium">" - Aaron Horning</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="mb-3 medium">With the trade space defined the first prototype underwent two years of testing and design changes aboard Jack O'Donnell's 65' Paul Mann out of Va. Beach. "I really owe it to Mr. O'Donnell, he allowed me to cut into his fishing day and test my prototypes to ultimately produce a great product. He believed in the product and me all along." - Aaron Horning</p>
            <p class="mb-3 medium">By 2008 the design was locked down, a mold was created and clone Marlin-X teasers stated coming to life one by one. "We build Marlin-X teasers one at a time from the heart, each one is a work of art." - Aaron Horning</p>
            <p class="mb-3 medium">Marlin-X teasers were unavailable for the past few years while Aaron and his wife Jenna focused on raising three daughters. The girls are older now and some time is now available to manage production again. "We are very fortunate to work with some very high-end successful people, none of them have ever told us they wished they didn't spend so much time at home." - Aaron Horning</p>
            <p class="mb-3 medium">Marlin-X teasers are now available again to the public. Order yours and enjoy the show.</p>

            <h2>Answers</h2>
            <ol class="mb-0 medium">
              <li>The simplest way to use the teaser is straight off a good teaser real, in the regular teaser position with a few large squids on droppers in front of it. It simply looks like a marlin is on your teaser all day.</li>
              <li>Blue marlin will try and eat Marlin-X. We have 5 reported cases of teasers getting smacked around by a big blue. Yes, they get scratched up and destroyed in some cases.</li>
              <li>The dark paint jobs works better. We will paint any special color schema you want but a simple dark paint job has been the best.  Observations are showing that an aggressively painted Marlin-X (bright colors/stripes) will still attract bill fish but the attracted fish are noticeably less aggressive than compared to using a dark colored Marlin-X. Also, every Marlin-X that has been hit by a blue marlin has been dark colored.</li>
              <li>The Marlin-X floats. This has been a bigger deal than we expected. We hear of many cases of a teaser getting disconnected from a boat and rescued shortly after. </li>
              <li>We have had many requests over the years to make a rubber version. We made a few rubber versions but they just didn't work anywhere near as good as the original foam/fiberglass design.  We are always trying to progress but for now its foam and fiberglass.</li>
              <li>Sailfish really like to swim alongside a Marlin-X . We had the owner of the PoorGirl (65 Paul Mann) call us from the waters off Isla Mujeres just to tell us, “I’ve got five sailfish swimming with Marlin-X right now!”</li>
              <li>We are asked if you can put Marlin-X behind a dredge. Sure you can, we have done it, but we enjoy it most on top where we can see it. There is minimal data available for effectiveness behind the dredge so there is probably more to explore.</li>
              <li>We are asked about pulling more than one Marlin-X, here is where the data really starts getting thin. We have pulled multiple Marlin-X at a time with minimal noticeable advantage over just one. But we are not convinced that only using one Marlin-X is the most efficient method yet. The whole idea of the decoy is to create a buddy/pack feeling for real fish to join in.  Many natural bait balls have more than one bill fish around them. But just like the dark vs bright paint scheme discussion above, every detail makes a difference. If you are going to pull more than one Marlin-X then you may need to rethink hooked bait placement relative to the main decoy pack. For instance do I pull 2-4 Marlin-X at the short/long-rigger distance and pull hooked baits in front at the flat lines? Or do I swim 2-4 Marlin-X in tight to the boat and put the "straggling" baits out back for curious following fish to eat. Or do we mix them in to the spread?... In any case using multiple Marlin-X is a very new concept to explore.</li>
              <li>$595 is a lot of money! Why so expensive? At first the price sounds high but it really isn't. The engineering and fabrication time involved makes this a really a good deal.</li>
